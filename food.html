                            see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
                            for a hearty portion of one of Egypt’s favourite street foods. This
                            filling meal is made up of rice, macaroni and lentils, topped with
                            tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
                            onions. It’s a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and
                            cheap. Exactly what the Egyptians were after!</p>

                        <h2>fuol and tameia</h2>

                        <p>Ta’meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
                            falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They’re a staple of
                            the Egyptian diet, mainly because they’re filling and use
                            ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
                            made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
                            qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
                            crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
                            Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
                            Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
                            perfect dish for all you vegos!</p>
